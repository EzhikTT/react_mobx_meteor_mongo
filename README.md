# react_mobx_meteor_mongo

This is a project repository for a small Meteor-React app project I made. 
It uses Mobx as the state manager and shows a couple of interesting patterns for
fetching Meteor data using a combination of mobx autorun and Meteor observe. It 
also shows how to use the mobx map() function to maintain UI state independently 
of the client side data.

I have put a commentary on this project on Medium here:
